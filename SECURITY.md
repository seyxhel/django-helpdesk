## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have discovered a bug impacting security in a supported version, please DO NOT file a Issue / Bug Report for it publicly.

Once reported, we'll be in touch to confirm the issue and work toward releasing a patch as soon as possible.

After a patch has been released, a new release will be tagged and uploaded to PyPi, etc. At that time, details of the issue will be announced publicly.
